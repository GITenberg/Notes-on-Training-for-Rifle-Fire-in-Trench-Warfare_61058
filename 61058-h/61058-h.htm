  <h2 class='c006'>TRAINING IN THE USE OF THE RIFLE FOR TRENCH WARFARE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>1.  Training in the use of the rifle includes that of the bayonet.
Fire action is alone treated in this paper, instruction in the use
of the bayonet having already been discussed elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c004'>2.  The rifleman in the trenches, no less than in the open, requires
as preliminary preparation the courses of individual and
combat instruction prescribed in the Small Arms Firing Manual.
The object of this paper is not to supersede any portion of
this manual, but to supplement it by stressing those features of
trench rifle fire that the experience of actual war has shown to
be possessed of an importance that was not fully appreciated
when the manual was prepared. So far as rifle fire exclusively
from trenches is concerned, the importance of <i>individual aimed
fire</i> up to the range of 400 yards is the principal feature that
has been so developed by the peculiar conditions prevailing on
the “western front” during the present European war, and
the training that needs to be stressed naturally comes under
the head of “individual instruction.” There is also a second
feature, essential to efficient <i>collective</i> firing either from
trenches or in the open, that has never received the attention
in our authorized manuals that its importance merits, though
that importance has long been recognized and has been ably
treated at the School of Musketry. It is that of the <i>necessity
for satisfactory working methods of describing targets</i>. The
growth of this necessity has been coincident with the development
of fire discipline, direction, and control.</p>

<p class='c004'>3.  The special importance of individual aimed fire in trench
warfare has been developed in Europe during the present war
in connection with what is there termed “sniping,” which has
become a specially important and highly technical service,
though it is merely a development of what has long been known
and practiced in the United States under the name of “sharpshooting.”
A consideration of some of the conditions under
which “sniping” is conducted will assist in emphasizing its
importance and in indicating the special qualifications and instruction
essential to efficiency.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>4. In modern trench warfare, as it exists in Europe to-day,
each belligerent occupies a system of trenches, of which the foremost,
or fire trenches, are frequently separated by only a few
yards, and rarely by more than four or five hundred yards. In
rear of the fire trenches there is a labyrinth of cover, approach,
support, reserve, and other trenches. Each system is strengthened
by obstacles, the most formidable and also the most common
of these are the barbed-wire entanglements. These trenches
and obstacles are being continually damaged by the opposing
artillery fire, and every opportunity is seized for raiding
enemy trenches through the openings so made. One of the
important functions of the sniper is that of protecting his own
trenches from enemy raids and his comrades from fire of snipers
and the prevention of repair of enemy trenches and obstacles in
order to keep the road open to raids from his own side. To
these ends he endeavors to meet with a bullet every exposure of
even a few square inches of the head or limb of an enemy and
at the same time to conserve his own life. To attain the first
object, that of hitting the enemy, requires the best possible
facilities for observation and fire, coupled with special qualities
and technical skill on the part of the sniper. The attainment
of the second object, that of conserving one’s own life, will depend
largely upon the judgment and skill displayed in selecting
and concealing the position of the firer. Each of these requirements
calls for special training and for special qualities inherent
in the sniper. To the training and skill of the expert game shot
must be added the craftiness of the poacher.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. From the preceding paragraphs it is evident that the service
of sniping can not be conducted in a haphazard way, but, on the
contrary, requires for its efficient conduct a carefully selected,
organized, equipped, and trained personnel.</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Organization.</i>—Based upon the best available information
from Europe, there should be organized in each battalion of
Infantry a “sniping” group composed of 1 noncommissioned
officer and 24 privates.</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Qualifications governing selections.</i>—Each member of the
sniping group should be a well-trained, intelligent, disciplined
soldier; a dead shot at short and mid ranges; brave, yet cautious;
cool, observant, patient, resourceful, and prompt. In
addition to the above, the noncommissioned officer in command
of the group should be a competent instructor in all that is
included in the training of the sniper and should possess good
judgment in the selection and preparation of snipers’ posts.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>(<i>c</i>) <i>Training.</i>—In addition to the preliminary training contemplated
in (<i>b</i>), the following features should be specially
developed:</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Rifle practice.</i>—The sniper must become expert in a broader
sense than is implied by the word as employed in ordinary
marksmanship classification. Ordinarily his target will be a
small and fleeting one, and his training should be such as to
enable him to quickly and accurately deliver a single shot at
objects varying from a 4–inch loophole at 100 yards to those the
size of a man’s body at 800 yards. The small object at short
range will be the most frequent target and indicates the most
important rifle training. The character of the target emphasizes
the importance of extreme accuracy of fire, and accuracy
of fire implies, in addition to correctness of aim, correct
knowledge of range, a correct knowledge of external influences,
such as light, heat, moisture, wind, and the personal equation
of the firer and the rifle. The sniper must continually practice
both with the military sights and with the adjuncts supplied him
and under conditions closely resembling those that will obtain
in actual trench work. The importance of concealment will
usually result in fire being delivered from rest, and the handling
of the rifle must not be accompanied by exposure of his position.
The soldier who has been thoroughly trained in the courses prescribed
in the Small Arms Firing Manual will have no difficulty
in improvising firing exercises with small bobbing or disappearing
targets that will develop skill along the lines indicated
above. In every exercise the judgment of the firer should be
expressed as to the influence of a cold piece, a hot piece; clouds,
heat, moisture, wind; a worn rifle; fouling; recent cleaning and
oiling, or whatever existing condition may exert an influence on
the path of the bullet. The estimation of ranges and their
determination by use of range finders should form an important
part of the training of a sniper.</p>

<p class='c004'><i>Reconnaissance</i> and <i>scouting</i>.—Under this head is included all
manner of observation with a view to obtaining information.
The sniper’s field of action will be limited, but within its sphere
it will be governed by the same principles that are prescribed
for reconnaissance parties and scouts, and will include the intelligible
rendering of reports.</p>

<p class='c004'>To this end the sniper must be trained in the reading of maps,
the making of sketches, the use of the prismatic compass,
the simpler and more common conventional signs, and the
rendering of both verbal and written reports. That the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>may not seem too large and formidable to him, his instruction
should be progressive and as simple as possible, with due care
to impress him with the necessity for everything he is required
to do. The American soldier will rarely fail to respond if he
can see the reasonableness of the demand made upon him.
Let him see that his own life and that of his comrades may
depend upon the accuracy of his knowledge of the following:</p>

<p class='c004'>1. The location of our own front line and that of the enemy,
so far as they are within his visual range.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. The location of any known or suspected enemy sniper’s
posts, machine-gun emplacements, observation posts, listening
posts, command stations, or probable routes of advance.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. The location and importance of dominating points in either
line.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. The importance of being able to pick out on the ground any
points of special importance or danger indicated on sketches or
maps turned over to him, and to determine from maps drawn
to scale the ranges to such points.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. How to find his way by the aid of a map or sketch from
his post to any specified point in our own trenches, and back
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>6. The importance of being able to intelligibly record and
graphically represent matters of importance to his commanding
officer or to the sniper who is to relieve him. In this connection
the special importance of exact truth in statements of fact,
and of the careful separation of matters of fact from those of
mere report or conjecture, should be duly stressed. Hearsay and
conjecture are often of great importance, but should be transmitted
as such, and in the case of conjecture the reasons therefor
should be stated.</p>

<p class='c004'>The above are simply a few instances to suggest to the instructor
how to go about the matter of instruction. Many men
will be already familiar with the subject, and the method may
be abridged, but in the case of an entirely uninstructed man a
step-by-step method of instruction must be followed. The training
should be such that it will be an entirely natural matter
for the sniper to observe and report as to:</p>

<p class='c004'>1. The attitude of the enemy (whether aggressive, alert,
active, etc.).</p>

<p class='c004'>2. Description of enemy seen, uniform, arms, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. Any new work evident; such as trenches and obstacles
strengthened, new emplacements, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>4. Position of machine guns, observation posts, sniper posts,
etc., discovered.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. Points in our own lines found to be specially dangerous,
and points of enemy line that menace them.</p>

<p class='c004'>6. Routes known to be used by the enemy.</p>

<p class='c004'>7. Routes of patrols.</p>

<p class='c004'>8. Points where ammunition or supplies are believed to be
dumped.</p>

<p class='c004'>9. Ranges to prominent or important points. This information
will be less likely to mislead if the following rules are
observed:</p>

<p class='c004'>Carefully indicate the point from which each range is taken.</p>

<p class='c004'>Use prominent, easily identified landmarks as reference
points.</p>

<p class='c004'>Indicate by whom and how ranges were determined.</p>

<p class='c004'>10. Report any repairs needed in trenches or obstacles.</p>

<p class='c004'>11. Position of suspected mines.</p>

<p class='c004'>6. <i>Equipment.</i>—Telescopes, rather low power, are preferable
to field glasses for observation and reconnaissance. Care must
be taken to render them as inconspicuous as possible and prevent
their location by the enemy through reflection of light
from the object glass.</p>

<p class='c004'>Telescopic periscope.</p>

<p class='c004'>Rifle rest.—Various sorts have been devised, usually not
merely to serve the purpose of a rest, but to expedite resumption
of aim and change in direction or elevation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Telescopic sights.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sniperscope.—(A device for aiming with the head below
the line of sight. Reports indicate that with this device the
tendency is to shoot high, and that they are only reasonably
accurate up to ranges of 200 yards. They are usually used
over parapets, between sandbags. Proper adjustment is essential
and great care necessary to prevent derangement.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Steel helmet and mask.</p>

<p class='c004'>Maps, sketches, note-book, message blanks, pencils, pocket
knife.</p>

<p class='c004'>Each post should have a range chart for use of all reliefs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The above is additional to the normal equipment of the
soldier.</p>

<p class='c004'>7. <i>Duties of commander of sniping group</i>:</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>a</i>) Training of snipers and maintenance of efficiency.</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>b</i>) To supervise the work of his unit.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>(<i>c</i>)  Responsibility for care of equipment.</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>d</i>)  To receive and transmit to the proper authority all information
turned over by the posts he relieves and by his own
posts.</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>e</i>)  To select the positions for sniper’s posts and supervise
the construction of loopholes and other special arrangements
when not already provided.</p>

<p>A SNIPERSCOPE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>8. <i>Location of sniper’s posts.</i>—Though engaged in trench warfare
snipers are not invariably located in trenches. When not
so located the sniper will avail himself of such cover as best
suits his purpose. If practicable he will so dress himself as to
blend with his surroundings, giving particular attention to his
face and hands. Masks of inconspicuous color are sometimes
worn. He must study the maps and the ground and endeavor
to determine in advance good localities for observation and
good lines of approach. His line of retreat must also be decided
on as early as possible. The arts of the deerstalker and
poacher, or those practiced in our early Indian troubles will be
of great use under these circumstances, as his success will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>depend largely upon his patience and cunning. Houses and
other buildings should be viewed with distrust, as they may
be closely observed by the enemy. Trees will also receive this
scrutiny. The best cover will be that which is least likely to
be suspected of affording concealment for a man.</p>

<p>A PREPARED SNIPER POSITION. A SNIPER USING A SNIPERSCOPE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Sniper’s positions in trenches may, according to circumstances,
be located in (<i>a</i>) the front line, (<i>b</i>) parados, (<i>c</i>) approach
trenches, (<i>d</i>) connecting trench, (<i>e</i>) dummy trench, (<i>f</i>) support
trenches, or any others affording the desired facilities. The
commander must study the terrain, the enemy’s trenches, the
advantages and disadvantages of each position considered, both
with reference to facilities for observation, fire, and concealment,
and with reference to danger from the enemy, and select
that which will best serve the purpose. He must then decide
as to measures for promoting observation and concealment, and
supervise their execution and the construction of the necessary
loopholes. Loopholes may be arranged of sandbags, iron pipes,
boxes, etc. It is better to have them run obliquely rather than
perpendicularly with respect to the trench line, and a curtain
should be provided to prevent their being discovered by light
showing through the hole. Loopholes near the ground are not
as readily seen as those higher up, and those located among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>débris and loose earth, leaves, branches, tumbled sods, etc., are
less easily detected than those located in a smooth slope. When
constructing loopholes care should be taken to disturb previously
existing conditions as little as possible lest the enemy observe
the change and profit by the hint. Several loopholes should be
provided for each post as the discovery of one by the enemy
renders it worthless for future use, and continued use of one
loophole will sooner or later result in detection.</p>

<p class='c004'>The best positions are usually in rear of the first line, so
placed as to command a view of the enemy’s trenches up to at
least 400 yards. This is not always possible and the best possible
must be selected. In any case alternative positions must
be arranged. Support trenches may afford better locations
than the fire trenches, but they have the objection of increasing
the range. If the post is detached an important consideration
is whether or not it can be entered or left unobserved during
daylight.</p>

<p class='c004'>9. <i>Conduct of the sniper.</i>—Snipers should work in pairs, exchanging
duties of observer every 15 or 20 minutes. They
should be relieved every two hours or oftener. It may be advantageous
to relieve one every hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>They will never fire merely to annoy, as this will lead to
disclosure of the position, with no adequate result. They will
closely examine their shelter and see that the fire opening is
so constructed as not to be affected by the blast of the rifle.
If shooting through a small aperture in brickwork, the opening
should be kept wet to prevent dust being blown out by
the discharge. Newly constructed loopholes should be left
unused for a time, so as to see if the enemy has detected it.
The curtain will always be kept in such position as to prevent
light showing through. Snipers must not be led by ruses to
fire fruitlessly and disclose their positions. Fire to kill. If
a large target is discovered, do not fire if it is possible to inform
the machine guns or the artillery. Search constantly for
machine guns and snipers; smash his periscopes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Attacks will afford great opportunities for the sniper, as the
enemy will then not be so alert for them, being busy with
other matters. Less caution will therefore be necessary. From
a position on a flank or anywhere that he can fire without interference
with our own men, he selects the most useful targets,
such as machine-gun men, officers and noncommissioned officers,
snipers, artillery observers, etc. He closely observes the flanks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>which are favorite places from which to break up an attack,
and endeavors to forestall the enemy’s fire. If the attack succeeds,
he covers the working parties during the organization of
the captured trench and watches for evidences of an intended
counterattack. If this is made, he fires on the enemy as he
shows himself in the approach trenches, picking off leaders
when possible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Much night work for snipers will rarely be advantageous.
The targets are then practically limited to patrols and sentries,
and there is great danger of firing into our own men or being
fired on by them. The flash of the rifle will disclose the position
if care is not taken to conceal it. Avoid the enemy’s listening
posts. Learn the hours at which the enemy repairs the gaps
in his obstacles or parapets and watch for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>10. <i>Description of targets.</i>—In paragraph 2 reference was
made to the necessity for a satisfactory working system for
designating or describing targets. One of our present embarrassments
lies in the multiplicity of methods and the incident
confusion in the mind of the soldier. Another source of
error lies in the tendency of men to fancy that the <i>ears</i> of
listening soldiers take in and digest a description as rapidly as
the <i>eye</i> can travel from point to point. The ear, as compared
with the eye, is very slow. The immediate deduction from this
is that descriptions must be shorn of all unnecessary words, and
that they must be as simple and clear as possible. It also emphasizes
the advantage of following so far as practicable fixed
methods of expression. Recruits should be taught the general
plan followed in describing targets in order that they may waste
no time from lack of comprehension of the relation of the
different elements of the description or the terms employed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The use of a single form will not suffice, since in some cases
the target is so evident that no mistake can be made, and the
simple designation such as “That troop of white-horse cavalry,
range 1,000 yards,” will identify it beyond all question; while
in other cases the particular target may be so obscure and liable
to confusion with other targets that a reference point and some
system of coordinates must be employed.</p>

<p class='c004'>In general, targets with reference to their designation will
fall under the following heads:</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>a</i>) Those that stand out so plainly that there can be no possibility
of doubt as the target meant.</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>b</i>) Those that are plainly visible, but are liable to be confused
with other targets of a similar nature and range.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>(<i>c</i>) Those less distinctly visible and more difficult to pick up
on account of peculiar background, confusion with other objects,
etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>d</i>) Targets visible only through field glasses, and that may
or may not present the additional difficulties of danger of confusion
with other objects.</p>

<p class='c004'>Case (<i>a</i>) has already been referred to. The system consists
in the simple announcement of: 1. The objective. 2. The range.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ingenious people sometimes combine horizontal and vertical
clock systems in designating a target whenever possible to do
so, but this is a violation of the rule of simplicity and should
never be done unless evidently necessary. The mere fact that
it is necessary or desirable to use a reference point does not
in all cases require use of both systems, as the reference point
may be so evident that no clock coordination is necessary. When
such designation <i>is</i> necessary, the horizontal clock face is used
in coordinating the reference point and the vertical clock face
for locating the subsequent points.</p>

<p class='c004'>11. Instruction in target description is simple but must be
thoroughly understood. An illustration by means of case (d)
will cover the entire subject so far as necessary.</p>

<p class='c004'>(<i>a</i>) Explain to the recruits the use of the horizontal clock
system as a means of indicating directions. Inform them that
they are, in this system, <i>always</i> at the center of the dial. Call
out various hours and require each recruit to extend his arm
in the direction he understands is indicated. Explain and correct
errors.</p>

<p class='c004'>Explain the use of the vertical clock system, impressing the
recruits with the fact that in this system the <i>reference point</i>
is always at the center of dial. Call out an hour and require
the recruit to name some object that is located on the hand of
the clock at the designated hour. A diagram on paper may be
of assistance. Explain and correct errors.</p>

<p class='c004'>Explain to the recruit that the angle subtended by the width
of one finger at arm’s length from the eye and that subtended
by the leaf of the rear sight to his rifle at 14 inches from the
eye has a chord 50 yards long at 1,000 yards distance. The
finger width and the sight leaf thus become known as units,
and either may be used in indicating distances laterally.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having selected a reference point, name some object near it
and require the recruit to tell you how many units (<i>fingers</i> or
<i>sight leafs</i>) apart they are.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
